# The cut file may record the events passing many different cuts.
# Similarly, we may want to make plots with values at various stages of selection.
# e.g. after cut A, and after cut C. To read the fewest entries possible,
# we should only load TTree entries for events passing the loosest cut
# we need to see every event from (i.e. the loosest cut we want to make plots about)
